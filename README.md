# StockMarketPrediction
This project builds and compares various machine learning and deep learning models to predict future stock index prices. We forecast three major market indexes: S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and NASDAQ Composite. By enriching the datasets with technical indicators and applying a variety of models, we assess which approaches work best for financial time series prediction.
